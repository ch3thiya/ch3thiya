## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a university student who loves technology and finding creative ways to make our lives easier. Iâ€™m currently working on some personal IoT and web development projects. I like to use my skills to create smart solutions while picking up new techniques.
<br>Iâ€™m always up for learning something new and would love to collaborate on projects with others.
<br>Feel free to reach outâ€”letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸ’«
